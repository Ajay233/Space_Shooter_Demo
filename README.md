# Space_Shooter_Demo

This space shooter game is a first attempt at making a game in Unity.  The majority of the assets were provided within Udemy course titled: `The Ultimate Guide to Game Development with Unity 2019`.  

You can try the game at https://space-shooter-webgl.herokuapp.com/

The codebase for this game is at https://github.com/Ajay233/Space_Shooter_Codebase (This repo just contains the current WebGL build of the game).

Heroku isn't the fastest hosting platform, so please bear with the loading.  

## Controls
- Use the directional keys to move left, right, up and down
- Use the space bar to fire lasers
- To `PAUSE` press `p`
- To `UNPAUSE` press `m` or use the mouse to select `Resume game` from the options in the pause menu.
- To `Quit` the game completely, press `esc` or use the mouse to click on the `Quit game` option in the pause menu.
- To go back to the `MAIN MENU`, click on the `Main menu` option in the pause menu.

## Full screen
You can make the game full screen, by clicking on the arrows icon next to `Space Shooter` in the bottom right of the screen.  This is a Unity feature of WebGL games and it only seems to expand the window once the game has been loaded.

## Gameplay
This is a basic space shooter game.  The aim is to get the highest score possible by destroying waves of enemies.  After completing each successive wave, the number of enemies will be increased, meaning you'll have to destroy an increasing number of enemies in order to complete subsequent waves.

### Powerups
To help you, there are three types of powerup that spawn:
- Speedup - Increases your movement speed for 7 seconds before returning to normal (this stacks so be careful lol)
- Triple shot - Grants you a total of 3 lasers per shot for 5 seconds, covering much more space, making enemies easier to hit safely. (Does not stack)
- Shield - This gives you a shield, protecting you for one hit, after you are hit the shield will fail and you'll be vulnerable until you can grab another shield powerup. (Does not stack)

## Disclaimer
This game is still a work in progress and I'll be making periodic improvements.

Enjoy :)
